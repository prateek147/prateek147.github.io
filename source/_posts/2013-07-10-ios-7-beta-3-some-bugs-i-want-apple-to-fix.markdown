So i have had IOS 7 on my iPhone 5 since the day it was released at WWDC 2013. Since then, i have seen a number of bugs being fixed with the coming beta versions. However, there are some bugs that are still there, easily reproducible and not fixed yet !

<h2>The black Background bug.</h2>

To reproduce this, you need to have only one app running. Make sure you are on this app and double tap the home button.

Now close this app by swiping your finger from the bottom to the top.

Come to home screen and you will see a black Background !

<h2>Unresponsive Sleep button!!</h2>

This happens when you reproduce the bug mentioned above. The sleep button on the top right doesn't seem to respond at all. It takes about 10-15 seconds before it starts functioning properly.

<h2>Siri Can't turn on the Flashlight !!</h2>

I swear i was able to do this on IOS 7 beta 1 and 2. But looks like it doesn't work on IOS 7 beta 3. It doesn't look like a feature change as i can't think of any reason why Apple would disallow turning on the flashlight via Siri. I think it's a useful feature and should be added with the final release.

Overall, IOS 7 Beta 3 is much more refined that the previous versions and i hope they will push a stable version in time for iPhone 5s. 

Have any bug to report in IOS 7 ? Let me know and i will add it to this blog with your name.
